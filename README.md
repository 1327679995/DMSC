# DMSC

### This is an offical implementation of "DMSC: Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework for Time Series Forecasting".

## Introduction
This paper focuses on Time Series Forecasting, proposed framework **DMSC(Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination)** processes intricate dependencies through three blocks: Embedded Multi-Scale Patch Decomposition Block(EMPD), Triad Interaction Block(TIB) and Adaptive Scale Routing Mixture-of-Experts(ASR-MoE). And a multi-layer progressive cascade architecture integrating EMPD and TIB.
